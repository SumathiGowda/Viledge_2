# VilEdge – A Village Issue Management System

VilEdge is a simple web app we built during college as a mini project. The goal was to create something useful for rural areas — a platform where villagers can report everyday issues like water problems, bad roads, health concerns, or school complaints, all in one place.
Once a user reports a problem, they get a tracking ID so they can follow up on it. The idea is to make it easier for people to raise their concerns and for authorities to respond faster.

## Why I Made It

This was a college-level project, mainly to help us get hands-on experience with:
- Working on a full project from start to finish
- Connecting frontend, backend, and database
- Solving real-life problems using tech

## Features
- User sign-up and login
- Raise complaints in different categories (like transport, health, education, water)
- Each complaint gets a unique tracking ID
- Admin panel to view and update issue status

## Tech Stack
We used:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Django
- **Database**: MySQL
